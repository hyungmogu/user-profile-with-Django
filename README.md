This is the seventh project to team tree house's Python Web Tech Degree.

    - the page should be visible only once the user has logged in
    - the profile page includes 1) first name, 2) last name 3) date of birth 4) confirm email 5) short bio 6) option to upload avatar

2. Set up validation for email, date of birth and the biography.
    - Date of birth accepts three formats  YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, or MM/DD/YY
    - Email validation checks if the email addresses match and is a valid format
    - Bio validation should check that the bio is 10 characters or longer and properly escapes HTML formatting

3. Set up "change password page" that updates user password
    - The page asks for 1) current password 2) new password 3) confirm password
